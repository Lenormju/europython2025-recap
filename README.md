# europython2025-recap

My recap of the EuroPython 2025.

From 2025-07-14 to 2025-07-20 in Prague (Czech Republic).

* Monday and Tuesday : tutorials (workshops)
* Wednesday, Thursday and Friday : conferences (talks)
* Saturday and Sunday : sprints (contribution to Open Source)

Additional events :

* Tuesday evening : speakers' dinner
* Wednesday evening : "pyvo" (beer)
* Thursday morning : data leaders breakfast
* Thursday evening : social event

## Tutorials

### Monday morning : Rambo Python

@Julien : clarify that the repo is the end-goal, that participants should start a new one
@Julien : prepare formatting/typechecking/typing exercices
@Julien : rename the repo to not have a dash (`-`) in its name, for the `package = true` trick

### Monday afternoon : PyScript

May be useful in some cases, still not convinced of its potential for global adoption (too many edge cases to not being a first-party Python target, nor a first-party for browsers)

### Tuesday morning : CI/CD with Python, K8s, TestContainers, AWS, Jenkins, ...

### Tuesday afternoon : Packaging Summit
